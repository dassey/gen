## ComfyUI Video Workflow Extractor

Extract the ComfyUI workflow embedded in a video's metadata — from a file on
your machine, or straight from the page the video is posted on.

Video parsing runs entirely in your browser via
[mediainfo.js](https://github.com/buzz/mediainfo.js); the workflow JSON is
never uploaded anywhere.

## How to use

### A local file

Drag and drop a video anywhere on the page, or pick it with the file input.

### A URL

Paste either a direct link to a video file or the address of the page the
video sits on, then press **Extract**. For a page, the app fetches the HTML
and looks for the video in `<video>`/`<source>` tags, `og:video` meta tags,
JSON-LD `contentUrl`, and any video URLs embedded in inline scripts. If it
finds more than one, you pick which to read.

Where the host supports HTTP range requests, only the few kilobytes MediaInfo
actually needs are downloaded rather than the entire video. Hosts that don't
support ranges fall back to a full download, with progress shown and a Cancel
button.

## About the network options

Browsers refuse to read another site's pages or files unless that site opts in
via CORS, and most don't. Every request is therefore tried directly first and
then retried through a list of public CORS relays, which you can reorder,
disable, or replace under **Network options**.

This is worth understanding before you paste a private link: **a relay sees the
URL you paste and the bytes it passes back.** Untick every relay to keep all
requests direct — extraction will then only work for hosts that send CORS
headers — or point the app at a relay you run yourself using the custom field.

The status log under the input reports which route each request took, so you
can always tell whether a relay was involved.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # production build into dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build
```

The build assumes it is served from `/gen/`. Set `BASE_PATH` to change that,
e.g. `BASE_PATH=/ npm run build` for a domain root.

Deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on every push to
`main`. That workflow needs the repository's Pages source set to **GitHub
Actions** (Settings → Pages) rather than a branch.
